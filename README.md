# causalregnet

This is a library for simulating realistic single-cell RNA sequencing data based on a given causal structure, scalable to the dimension of genome-wide gene perturbation screens.

Implementation of method developed in [*"Simulation-based Benchmarking of Causal Structure Learning in Gene Perturbation Experiments"*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06015).
